### 1. Create a Virtual Environment
In this project, we are using virtualenv to manage dependencies and the virtual environment. Before executing the following command to create the virtual environment, ensure that virtualenv is installed on your system. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```
pip show virtualenv
```

If virtualenv is installed, this command will display information about the installed package. If it's not installed, you can install it using pip:
```
pip install virtualenv
```

Once virtualenv is installed, navigate to the project folder and execute the following commands to create the virtual environment:
```
mkdir .venv/
```
```
python -m virtualenv .venv/
```

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment
To activate the virtual environment, execute the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

If you're using command-prompt on Windows, enter this command
```
".venv/Scripts/activate" 
```

If you're using terminal on Windows, enter this command
```
. .venv/Scripts/activate
```

If you're using Linux, enter this command
```
. .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install the Required Dependencies
